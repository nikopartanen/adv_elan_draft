# Manipulating ELAN files with Pympi

Pympi is a very mature Python library and using it is enjoyable. However, I myself usually feel the most comfortable when I have the data in an R data frame, so I often fall back into that no matter what. I strongly encourage to test further data manipulation and analysis in Python, I assume that especially [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) should be very useful.
